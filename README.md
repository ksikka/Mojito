# Mojito

Divide your free time fairly amongst side-projects.

In asana, write a weekly time allotment for each project, and add time estimates to tasks.
Mojito will pack as many tasks as can fit into your allotment per week, and show you your progress.
Now you can see what you should actually be working on, instead of following your impulse.

Mojito turns this:
